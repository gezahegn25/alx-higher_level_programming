0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
Tasks

0. Print a list of integers
Write a function that prints all integers of a list.
Prototype: def print_list_integer(my_list=[]):

1. Secure access to an element in a list
Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
Prototype: def element_at(my_list, idx):
   
2. Replace element
Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
Prototype: def replace_in_list(my_list, idx, element):
   
3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!
Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
Prototype: def print_reversed_list_integer(my_list=[]):
   
4. Replace in a copy
Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).
Prototype: def new_in_list(my_list, idx, element):

5. Can you C me now?

9. Find the max
Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.
Prototype: def max_integer(my_list=[]):
   
10. Only by 2
Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
Prototype: def divisible_by_2(my_list=[]):
   
11. Delete at
Write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.

   
12. Switch
Complete the source code in order to switch value of a and b

   
13. Linked list palindrome
Technical interview preparation:
Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

14. CPython #0: Python lists
CPython is the reference implementation of the Python programming language. Written in C, CPython is the default and most widely used implementation of the language.
